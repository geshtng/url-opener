# url-opener

## Description
Open your favorite websites with easy!

## How to use
Open `urls.txt` and insert your favorite websites!

### Windows
Just open `urlop.bat`

### Linux
```bash
# In case does not work on the first try, use this command:
$ sudo chmod +x urlop.sh

# Then open using this command:
$ ./urlop.sh
```

### Mac OS
You need to change the code base on your browser that you need. </br>
I use Safari as an example. If you want to switch to another browser, you can follow these steps:

1. Open `urlop.sh` using your text editor.
2. On line 12, change **"Safari"** to your browser. Example:
    ```bash
    open -a "Google Chrome" $line
    ```
3. Save and its ready to use.


```bash
# In case does not work on the first try, use this command:
$ sudo chmod +x urlop.sh

# Then open using this command:
$ ./urlop.sh
```
